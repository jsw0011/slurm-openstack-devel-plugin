# Slurm plugin development environment for OpenStack

The repository contains scripts for creating a temporary development environment for developing extensions for Slurm batch scheduler. Itâ€™s rather impossible to easily modify the configuration of the production
deployment without affecting other users of HPC systems. Therefore, I created a script to automate
the HPC development environment on OpenStack. The main advantage of using the OpenStack is,
that it can effortlessly stop or update our cluster stack. I used the Heat Orchestration Templates
(HOT) to describe the OpenStack architecture and the Ansible automation tool for installation and
configuration. The installation and configuration supports the CentOS 8 Stream, but can be quite
simply adapted for other operating systems supported by the Slurm (batch scheduler).

Read the [`article`](https://github.com/jsw0011/slurm-openstack-devel-plugin/blob/main/2022-PPFIT-SlurmOpenStackPluginDevel.pdf) for more information.

Installation can be watched by `tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log` in master node.
User, who would like to e.g. `sbatch` executable or script, should be in the `slurm` group. JWT token can be obtained by `scontrol token username=<username>` as superuser.
## Structure
